Happy coding everyone !
<h3><span>Prerequisites</b></h3>
Alot of the code here is written using <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/'>google colab</a>, so you can pretty much get away without installing anything, but just incase you want to run the code locally on your machine download <a href='https://anaconda.cloud/'>Anaconda</a>, it comes pre-loaded with all the necessary libraries.
<h3><b>Installion and running</b></h3>
if you arent new to linux or termux the you probably know the <code>git clone</code> command which install the script and saves it into a <code>Data-science-portflio</code> folder for those who may not know this well the pprocess is down below.
<ul>
<li><code>cd Data-science-portfolio</li></code>
</ul>
Now you are good to go<br>
