### Data dashboards


we deploy various data science projects using framewroks like dash, flask and kivy. The projects vary from finance, industrail, hospital data etc. Updates are added every week for the rest of God knows when. Am hoping to get to atleast 30 projects, so thats basically 30 weeks, yikes!. 
Feel free to support me, all the source code is free, fork it, pull request etc. 

### NB// dash is pretty much useless so dont use it to deploy your apps.
